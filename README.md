# Monk's Recommended Modules
This is just my list of modules that I like to use.  I'll keep it updated as I change my preferences.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup.  Once in a Foundry game, enable to module and have it install all the dependencies.  That's all it does.  Then you can disable it.

## Bug Reporting
I'm sure there are lots of issues with it.  It's very much a work in progress.
Please feel free to contact me on discord if you have any questions or concerns. ironmonk88#4075
